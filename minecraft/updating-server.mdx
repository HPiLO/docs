Updating your server software is a very simple process, there are two ways to do this

Manual update
---
1. Download the latest version of the server software you are using from their websites
2. Stop your server and create a backup just in case the update fails
3. Delete the old server software JAR file (usually named ```server.jar```)
4. Place the new JAR file in the same directory as the old one, ensuring the name of the JAR file is the same
5. Start your server, and run ```/version``` or ```/about``` to ensure the server is running the new version

Automatic update
